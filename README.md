# Maternal-Influences-on-Infant-Birth-Weight

In the quest to find out the affects of high and low birth weights, data was taken from the Child Health and Development Studies in 1961 and 1962 to address the question of whether there is a link between mother's prepregnancy weight, mother's race, and maternal smoking with birth weight of their babies. The Gestation dataset can be found in the R package: mosaicData. Low birth weights (\< 5 lbs. 8 oz.) can result in infants with breathing problems, bleeding in the brain, infections, etc (March of Dimes). High birth weights (\> 9 lbs. 15 oz.), on the other hand, can have problems at birth like longer delivery times, injury to the baby such as broken collar bones or damaged nerves in the arms, and more (Large for Gestational Age). With the `birthwt` dataset, we will discover maternal influences on infant birth weight and find which independent variables play a significant role in predicting birth weight. I hypothesize that a mother's pre-pregnancy weight, race, and smoking habits will have a significant effect on their infant's birth weight.
